Some files are too big for github, so i zipped them.
They need to be unzipped, just once, then the gitignore should take care of them.
files are:
ground-software/CarnoSpaceDashboard/Assets/Real Stars Skybox/StarSkybox04/CubemapStars.cubemap
ground-software/CarnoSpaceDashboard/Assets/Real Stars Skybox/StarSkybox04Named/CubemapStarsNamed.cubemap
ground-software/CarnoSpaceDashboard/Assets/Real Stars Skybox/StarSkybox04NamedConstell/CubemapStarsNamedConstellations.cubemap
the corresponding .7z file is in the same folder as the original.
